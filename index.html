            <p class="about-us__history-text">The Pinot Noir Winery has been a family-owned winery since its founding in the late 1990s. The family of winemakers have passed down their winemaking knowledge and techniques from generation to generation, creating a winemaking tradition that continues to this day. The Pinot Noir Winery was founded by John Smith and his wife, Mary Smith.</p>
            <p class="about-us__history-text">John was a farmer and a winemaker, and Mary was a cook and baker. Together they recognized the potential of winemaking in the area and set out to create a winery that would produce high-quality wines.</p>
            <p class="about-us__history-text">The Smiths built the winery on a piece of land that John had purchased in the late 1990s. He cleared the land, planted the vines, and built the winery from the ground up. He also developed a unique method of winemaking that would become the hallmark of the Pinot Noir Winery. Now it is recognized by all wineries around the world.</p>
            <p class="about-us__history-text">Our winemaking method is based on European methods. We use natural fermentation methods and barrels to age the wine and indigenous grape varieties to make the wines, which gave them a unique flavor profile.</p>

                                <p>Wine aging and bottling are two important steps in the wine-making process. Aging allows the wine to develop its flavor and character while bottling seals the bottle and prepares it for storage or sale.</p>
                                <p>Aging is a process that takes place in barrels, stainless steel tanks, or bottles. Bottling is the process of transferring the finished wine from the aging vessel into bottles and sealing them.</p>
